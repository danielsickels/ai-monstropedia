Argillite Monstropedia is a codex of AI-generated monsters inspired by classic monster-collection games like Pok√©mon. In the game, Argillite Tamers, tamers collect clay to mold into these creations. Each creature is uniquely designed based on AI-generated prompts and follows structured attributes:

Name,  
Type (Elemental category),  
Move Set (4 unique abilities)  

This project aims to blend AI creativity with game-inspired themes to produce a diverse and interactive monster encyclopedia. It utilizes huggingface's stable diffusion models to create images for the monsters; however, this will not be shared here.
