Argillite Monstropedia is a codex of AI-generated monsters inspired by classic monster-collection games like Pok√©mon. In the game, Argillite Tamers, tamers collect clay to mold into these creations. Each creature is uniquely designed based on AI-generated prompts and follows structured attributes:

Name
Type (Elemental category)
Move Set (4 unique abilities)

This project aims to blend AI creativity with game-inspired mechanics to produce a diverse and interactive bestiary. It utilizes our proprietary monster generation used within the game; however, this will not be shared here - simply a project to display some of my frontend web-development skills!


This is a boostrap boilerplate Next.js app.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, head to ```localhost:3000```
